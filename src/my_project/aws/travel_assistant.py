"""CAPSTONE PROJECT — Travel Assistant Agent.

This deliberately mirrors the travel-planner example from Module 1, so
you END where Module 1 BEGAN — but now you build it yourself.

It exercises every skill from both chapters:
  * custom tools (@tool + type hints + docstrings)
  * multiple tools that feed into each other
  * a pre-built community tool (calculator)
  * a system prompt
  * the agentic loop doing multi-step planning

WHAT TO WATCH: the agent calls get_weather_forecast FIRST, feeds those numbers
into suggest_packing_list, then prices the trip and compares to the budget.
Nobody wrote that sequence — the loop worked it out.
